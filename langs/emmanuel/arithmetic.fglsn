EmmanComment Arithmetic example

A = EmmanInt 10
B = EmmanInt 5

SUM = A + B
DIFFERENCE = A - B
PRODUCT = A * B
QUOTIENT = A / B

EmmanPRINT(EmmanString "SUM:", SUM)
EmmanPRINT(EmmanString "DIFFERENCE:", DIFFERENCE)
EmmanPRINT(EmmanString "PRODUCT:", PRODUCT)
EmmanPRINT(EmmanString "QUOTIENT:", QUOTIENT)
